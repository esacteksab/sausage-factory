## What

I need a pig pen (wow, not sure how I got on this pork theme) so to speak. A place where I can experiment and not litter my local development environments. I've tried to use branches and it isn't great. So this repository exists to allow me to do things that I'm too scared to try in another repository.

### I'll do a little of everything here

- Go
- Python
- Elixir (been a minute)
- (quick and)"dirty" shell scripts
- HTML
- CSS
- Terraform/OpenTofu
- CI/CD tool evaluations

### Things I'm dabbling with at the moment:

- My first GitHub CLI extension written in Go
- My first Hugo Theme. Created with `hugo new theme`. I haven't done professional web development since 2006. I definitely have not kept up to date on things. Theme is built to be light-weight. Also dipping my toes in the water with TailwindCSS.
- Terraform Modules. I have _opinions_.

## What This Isn't

### It's not my personal blog.

Like a lot of personal blogs, mine has been neglected. The majority of the content on it is _barely_ applicable today. And something that's been on my mind is Google results have changed. It feels like queries are often returned with the same few sites as the top results. Good for them and their SEO, but I'm left wondering is the ability to reach folks possible.

### Production-worthy Anything

Unless you're looking for new colorful words to add to your git commit messages, nothing here should be used in a professional environment. Inspiration at best on a good day, down wind from this pig pen. If something does come from this space worthy of production, then it'll have its own repository or blog post. _Then_ you can yeet that shit in Prod on a Friday before a holiday weekend.
